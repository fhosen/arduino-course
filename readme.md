This project holds all the examples and exercies from the [Udemy Course: Arduino Programming and Hardware Fundamentals with Hackster](https://www.udemy.com/course/arduino-programming-and-hardware-fundamentals-with-hackster/)

The board I am using is the MEGA 2560, which is slightly different from the classic Arduino ONE.
